A well-structured Epic, Task, and Bug template improves clarity, ensures alignment across teams, and reduces friction in execution. Below is a practical framework for structuring these key work items in your task management system.

---

## Epics

Epics should be kept lightweight, focusing on a single **Objective** and set of **Key Results** that align with the team **OKR** (Objectives and Key Results). This approach ensures clarity for both technical and non-technical stakeholders.

### Structure

- **Objective:** A specific and clearly defined goal that is easy to understand by anyone in the business.
- **Key Results:** A set of **S.M.A.R.T.** (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Realistic, and Timely) criteria to track the progress of the objective.

### Considerations

- Ensure the **objective is well-articulated** and concise.
- Key results should be **measurable and objectively verifiable**.

## Tasks

Tasks provide detailed, actionable steps for team members. They should be structured to clearly communicate the persona, the need, and the reason behind the need.

### Structure

- **User Story:** "As a [persona], I want to [action], so that [reason]."
- **Acceptance Criteria:** A single, concise list covering:
  - **Business need** being addressed.
  - **Testing requirements** (e.g., unit, integration, regression tests).
  - **User Experience** considerations (liaise with UX designers for mock-ups/storyboards).
  - **API** details (route, HTTP methods, response statuses, schema, etc.).
  - **Performance expectations** (e.g., Largest Contentful Paint, API response time limits).
  - **Release Strategy** (technical and business perspectives, including support considerations).

### In-Progress/Working Section

- **Activity Checklist:**
  - A micro-sliced list of actions required to complete the task, created before work begins.
  - Based on the **Elephant Carpaccio** technique [(see more here)](https://medium.com/@olivercecilspann/elephant-carpaccio-exercise-an-experience-report-207f0cc79c34).
  - Helps ensure continuity if another engineer needs to take over the task.

## Bugs

Bug reports should provide clear and reproducible information to aid efficient resolution.

### Structure

- **Context:**
  - **Expected Behavior:** A concise description of the correct behavior.
  - **Current Behavior:** A description of the undesirable current behavior.
- **Reproducing the Bug:**
  - **Step-by-step reproduction guide.**
  - **Table for tracking test attempts:**
    - Result (PASS/FAIL)
    - Environment (DEV/TEST/PROD)
    - Time
    - User
    - Note
  - **Encouragement to attach screenshots and/or screen recordings.**

### In-Progress/Working Section

- **Activity Checklist:**
  - Same format as tasks, providing a clear outline of steps needed to address the bug.

## Why This Format Works

- **Low Friction:** The templates are lightweight and encourage meaningful participation.
- **Concise & Structured:** Bullet points and checklists promote clarity and brevity.
- **Improved Collaboration:** The **Activity Checklist** ensures seamless hand-offs between team members.
- **Actionable & Measurable:** Clear criteria and structured documentation reduce ambiguity.

By keeping templates lean and emphasizing clarity, teams can work with greater autonomy and effectiveness while ensuring efficiency and alignment across all work items.
