## Helping You Determine if a Job Offer is the Right Fit

When I recently received a job offer, I found myself uncertain about whether it was the right opportunity. To better assess the decision, I created a [Radar Chart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radar_chart) to compare key factors that matter to me in a job, evaluating both my existing role and the new opportunity side by side.

### How to Use the Radar Chart for Your Own Decision-Making

If you’d like to do the same, you can fork this [GitHub repository](https://github.com/svo/accept-new-job-guidance) and customize it to reflect your own priorities.

#### Adjusting the Weightings

To tailor the chart to your preferences, modify the weightings by updating the order in the **index.html** file. The list order determines how weightings are applied:

- Higher index positions receive higher weightings.
- These weightings are normalized and combined with the values you assign in the data.

#### Updating the Data Values

The next step is to update the data values to reflect:

- What you personally prioritize in a job.
- How well your current role aligns with those priorities.
- How well the new job offer matches them.

The values should be set between **1 and 5**, where **1** represents a low fit and **5** represents a strong fit.

### The Technology Behind the Visualization

This repository utilizes [D3.js](https://d3js.org/) for data visualization and specifically leverages [radar-chart-d3](https://github.com/tpreusse/radar-chart-d3/) to render the Radar Chart.
