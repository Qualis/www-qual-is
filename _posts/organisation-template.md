I've been working on a template to help you and your organisation thrive. Whether you're leading an engineering team, scaling a startup, or refining an established organisation's structure, this **Organisation Template** provides a structured approach to defining, communicating, and evolving your teams for long-term success.

## What is the Organisation Template?

This [GitHub repository](https://github.com/svo/organisation-template) is a living blueprint for structuring teams, defining clear roles, and managing decision-making processes. By forking and customising this template, you can create a tailored organisational structure that aligns with your company's strategy and culture.

## How to Get Started

1. **Fork the repository**: [organisation-template](https://github.com/svo/organisation-template)
2. **Modify the content** to fit your organisation's needs.
3. **Build the Docker images** using the instructions in [BUILD.md](https://github.com/svo/organisation-template/blob/main/BUILD.md).
4. **Deploy** to your infrastructure of choice and start using it!

## What's Included?

This template provides a structured approach to organisational design, combining best practices from **Team Topologies, Thoughtworks, and Agile methodologies** to help teams operate efficiently and effectively.

### Team Structure & Communication

- **[Team Topologies Framework](https://teamtopologies.com/key-concepts)** - A modern approach to team organization that defines four key team types (Stream-aligned, Platform, Enabling, and Complicated Subsystem) and interaction modes (Collaboration, Facilitation, and X-as-a-Service) to optimise software delivery.
- **Role Definitions** - Clearly defined organisational functions and roles, ensuring clarity and efficiency.
- **PlantUML-Generated Visualisations** - Communicate team structures and roles with dynamic diagrams.
- **Function to Location & Role Distribution** - Visual representations of organisational structure and role allocation.
- **Sample Team Charter** - Create a clear mission statement to keep your teams happy and productive.

### Decision-Making & Governance

- **[Thoughtworks Technology Radar](https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar)** - Assessing and adopting new technology stacks in engineering and architecture, providing insights on best practices and emerging trends.
- **Sensible Defaults** - Organisational guidelines for adopting, maintaining, trialing, or removing technology decisions using an Architectural Decision Record (**ADR**) process.
- **Decision Management Mechanisms**:
  - **[Architecture Decision Records (ADR)](https://cognitect.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions)** - A structured method for documenting architectural decisions and the reasoning behind them, ensuring transparency and consistency.
  - **[RAPID Model](https://www.bain.com/insights/rapid-tool-to-clarify-decision-accountability/)** - A decision-making framework that helps teams clarify roles in decision-making processes by defining who Recommends, Agrees, Performs, Inputs, and ultimately Decides.
  - **[RAID Analysis](https://www.techagilist.com/agile/scrum/raid/)** - A risk management tool used in Agile projects to track Risks, Assumptions, Issues, and Dependencies.

### Planning & Execution

- **Task Management Frameworks**:
  - **[RACI Model](https://racichart.org/the-raci-model/)** - A responsibility assignment matrix that clarifies who is Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, and Informed for each task or project.
  - **Decision & Risk Mitigation Strategies** - Guidelines for handling decisions effectively, avoiding blind spots, and ensuring cross-functional alignment.
- **Outdated Design Management**:
  - **Deliberate Outdated Design Register** - A structured approach to tracking intentional outdated design.
  - **Bit Rot & Outdated Design Reviews** - Strategies for preventing long-term architectural degradation.
- **Incident Management & Response**:
  - **Incident Ownership & RACI Model** - A structured approach for defining responsibilities during outages.

### Cost, Profitability & Scaling

- **Cost Awareness Strategy**:
  - **Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)** - Tracking infrastructure, third-party services, and operational expenses.
  - **Profitability Metrics** - Using **ARPU** (Average Revenue Per User) and **LTV** (Customer Lifetime Value) to measure long-term business sustainability.
- **Scalability Frameworks**:
  - **Guidelines for Evolving Team Structures** - Recommendations for growing teams without sacrificing efficiency.

## Visualising Your Organisation

To help teams understand their roles and interactions, the template includes **PlantUML-generated diagrams**.

### Examples

#### **Legend for interpreting the diagrams:**

## Why Use This Template?

### Standardisation Without Rigidity

The Organisation Template provides structured defaults but allows for flexibility. Teams can tailor the template to their specific needs while maintaining a high level of standardisation across the organisation.

### Clearer Accountability & Decision Making

Using models like **RACI** and **RAPID**, teams can clarify who is responsible for what, improving efficiency and reducing ambiguity in decision-making.

### Improved Team Collaboration & Scaling

By leveraging **Team Topologies** concepts, this template helps define interaction modes (Collaboration, Facilitation, X-as-a-Service) and supports the natural scaling of teams.

### Proactive Risk & Outdated Design Management

Built-in **RAID Analysis** and **Outdated Design Registers** ensure that risks, assumptions, and system entropy are managed proactively rather than reactively.

### Alignment Between Engineering & Business Objectives

Integrates financial and operational considerations, ensuring that technology decisions align with business profitability and scalability goals.

## Conclusion

The **Organisation Template** is designed to help your company achieve clarity, efficiency, and scalability in its structure. By leveraging this repository, your teams can focus on innovation rather than getting bogged down in inefficiencies.
