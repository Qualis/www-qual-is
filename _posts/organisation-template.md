## Organise your teams for combined health, happiness and success

I have been working on some things to help you and your organisation ðŸŽ‰

Fork this [GitHub repository](https://github.com/svo/organisation-template) and modify it to your hearts content. The instructions on how to modify the content and build the docker images is in the [BUILD.md](https://github.com/svo/organisation-template/blob/main/BUILD.md) file. Once you have the images you can then deploy to your infrastructure of choice.

It includes:

- The use of the nomenclature from [Team Topologies](https://teamtopologies.com/key-concepts) to define team boundaries and interaction modes
- Images generated from some [PlantUML](https://plantuml.com/) templates to communicate team and role structures
- [Thoughtworks](https://www.thoughtworks.com/) radars for communicating sensible defaults for engineering and architecture
- Suggested tooling and mechanisms for managing decisions
  - [Architecture Decision Records (ADR)](https://cognitect.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions)
  - [RAPID Model](https://www.bain.com/insights/rapid-tool-to-clarify-decision-accountability/)
- Tooling and mechanisms for planning and managing sets of tasks
  - [RACI Model](https://racichart.org/the-raci-model/)
  - [RAID Analysis](https://www.techagilist.com/agile/scrum/raid/)
- A sample team charter to help you have happy and productive peeps
- Approaches to managing technology entropy
- Guidelines on software development and delivery management
- A strategy for managing Technical Debt
- An approach for communicating cost and profitability
- A view on incident management

The following image is the legend for the [PlantUML](https://plantuml.com/) documents.

With the following being an example illustration of a potential role to function distribution.

I will be continuing to be update this as a template, and hope that it proves useful or interesting.
