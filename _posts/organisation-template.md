I've been working on a framework to help you and your organisation thrive. Whether you're leading an engineering team, scaling a startup, or refining an established organisation's structure, this **Organisation Template** provides a structured approach to defining, communicating, and evolving your teams for long-term success.

## What is the Organisation Template?

This [GitHub repository](https://github.com/svo/organisation-template) is a living blueprint for structuring teams, defining clear roles, and managing decision-making processes. By forking and customising this template, you can create a tailored organisational structure that aligns with your company's strategy and culture.

3. **Build the Docker images** using the instructions in [BUILD.md](https://github.com/svo/organisation-template/blob/main/BUILD.md).
4. **Deploy** to your infrastructure of choice and start using it!
