## Make your macOS setup testable and repeatable

For quite some time I have been using [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/) to manage my **macOS** setup.

[https://github.com/svo/my-macos-setup](https://github.com/svo/my-macos-setup)

Since the setup has a great many things within it. I would suggest forking the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/svo/my-macos-setup) and modifying it to your needs.

You can remove roles that you donâ€™t want in your setup by removing the corresponding entry in the **roles** section of the **playbook.yml** file.

If you want to see what is in a role, as some are bundles of things like e.g. **cli-tools**, you can browse the **roles** directory and open the corresponding **tasks/main.yml** file.
