### So what might it actually look like?

Well, I like to use [Trello](https://trello.com/) to capture and communicate progress on things ðŸ™‚

I use the [Scaled power-up](https://screenful.com/scaled-for-trello) and have the Objectives setup as epics with the Key Results being the tasks associated.
