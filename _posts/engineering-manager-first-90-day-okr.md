The following personal Objectives and Key Results (OKR) are a potential set to help you achieve positive results.

The priority order and/or relevance will depend on you and the business.

## Tracking in Notion

![Notion Example](/assets/blog/engineering-manager-first-90-day-okr/notion.png "Notion Example")

## Committed and Aspirational OKR

When setting **OKR**, it's important to distinguish between **committed** and **aspirational** **OKR**. This distinction helps ensure clarity in expectations and alignment with business goals.

- **Committed OKR**: These are objectives that **must be achieved** within the defined period of time. They are closely tied to key business priorities, and their successful completion is expected. Missing a committed **OKR** signals a gap in execution that needs to be addressed.
- **Aspirational OKR**: These are ambitious goals that **push beyond current capabilities** and aim for breakthrough performance. They are often long-term and may not be fully achieved within a single cycle. Aspirational **OKR** inspire innovation and drive significant progress.

### Applying This to Your First 90 Days

- Some **OKR** in the examples below, such as **"We Have a Budget Plan"**, are **committed OKR**, meaning they need to be completed.
- Others, such as **"We Have a Defined Set of Cultural Norms and Values"**, may be **aspirational OKR**, aiming for deeper cultural alignment over time.
- It's critical to align expectations with your manager and peers to determine which **OKR** are committed and which are aspirational.
