title: "How We Build Truth: Patterns Across Science and Religion"
excerpt: "Looking at how we construct knowledge, intriguing patterns emerge across seemingly different domains. Science extends our senses with instruments, religion builds meaning through ritual and tradition, and AI processes reality through data and algorithms. Through the lens of philosophy, we can explore whether these different approaches to truth-making might share more fundamental similarities than we typically recognize."

---------------------------------------

With an **interest in philosophy, psychology, and science**, I often reflect on the nature of truth. **While agnosticism typically means skepticism toward religious claims, I apply that same critical approach to scientific claims, examining both domains with equal scrutiny**; neither offers "the answer", but both reveal how humans construct meaning and navigate reality.

Science is often cast as the opposite of religion: objective where religion is subjective, rational where religion is faithful. But the more I think about it, the more it seems that **science is itself a kind of religion**: not in theology, but in how it builds a **worldview**, organizes collective belief, and provides rituals for determining what is "True".

Martin Heidegger helps illuminate this. For Heidegger, human existence (*Dasein*) is always embedded in the world, always interpreting reality through our tools, language, and cultural horizons.

We never encounter raw reality, only reality as it appears to us through our particular ways of being in the world. A hammer shows up as equipment for hammering, not as an arrangement of molecules. Science, like religion, is simply one way reality can show itself to us.

## The Evolution of Sense Organs

Human beings once perceived reality only through biological sense organs: eyes, ears, skin, nose, tongue. Religion and myth grew out of what those organs revealed and what they could not explain.

Science extended this perception with instruments: **microscopes, telescopes, sensors, particle detectors**. Each invention became an artificial sense organ, creating new ways of perceiving and thus new truths.

But these are still **interfaces, not reality itself**. Donald Hoffman's *Interface Theory of Perception (ITP)* argues that perception is like a desktop: icons that hide complexity and enable action. The microscope shows us a bacterium, not reality "as it is".

Heidegger would add that truth (*aletheia*) is always unconcealment within a horizon. Though he would resist framing scientific instruments as "enhanced sense organs", preferring to see them as different modes of world-disclosure, the core insight remains: our technological tools reshape what can appear as real. They extend our horizon of unconcealment, but they do not dissolve its limits. What we call "truth" is simply what shows itself given our current modes of disclosure.

## The Ritual of Method

Religion has rituals: prayers, sacraments, ceremonies. Science has its own ritual: the **scientific method**.

Hypothesize, test, measure, replicate. This is how science decides truth. But here is the paradox: what if we had **an infinite sample size**? Would we discover that our sense organs and instruments are themselves flawed, embedding error we never saw?

In that case, the ritual does not reveal timeless truth, only provisional truth. What was once unquestionable (Newtonian mechanics) becomes replaced by Einstein, and then by quantum mechanics. Each new paradigm is not the end of error, but a new way of managing it.

Through Heidegger's lens, this is the work of *Dasein*: truth is always situated, always interpretive, always bound to the tools of its time.

This ritualistic approach serves a deeper function: not revealing absolute truth, but generating useful orientations toward reality.

## Science as Instrumentalism

Philosophically, science is less about eternal truth than about **instrumentalism**. What works, what predicts, what allows survival and progress.

An instrumentalist view says: truth is not correspondence with reality, but the most useful orientation toward it. Science provides orientation for technology, prediction, and control; just as religion provides orientation for community, ethics, and meaning.

Both science and religion are instrumentalist in this sense: they are not mirrors of reality, but compasses for navigating it.

This instrumentalist view helps explain why scientific truths prove provisional; they are tools that work until better tools emerge.

### But Science Actually Works!

A common objection arises: "But science works! It cures diseases, builds rockets, creates technology that transforms lives. Religion doesn't deliver practical results in the same way."

This objection misses the point. Religion also "works"; it builds communities, provides meaning, offers ethical guidance, and delivers psychological comfort in the face of mortality and uncertainty. Science's reproducibility and universal applicability are genuinely distinctive features, but the question isn't whether science or religion work, but what kind of "working" constitutes truth.

Both are effective tools for human flourishing in different domains. Science excels at prediction and control; religion excels at meaning and community. Neither provides access to reality "as it is".

## The Social Architecture of Belief

Science doesn't just resemble religion philosophically; it mirrors religion institutionally and psychologically. Universities function as cathedrals, journals as sacred texts, peer review as orthodoxy enforcement. Citations become scripture, with frequent references conferring authority. Tenure resembles priesthood: institutional protection for those who've proven their devotion.

Retraction serves as excommunication, removal from the community of legitimate voices. Grant funding operates like tithing, concentrating resources among the faithful. Even scientific conferences resemble religious gatherings: communal reinforcement of shared beliefs, ritual presentations, and the social bonding that maintains institutional coherence.

Beyond these institutional parallels, both science and religion serve similar psychological functions. They offer comfort against uncertainty by providing explanatory frameworks. Science promises that chaos has underlying order discoverable through method; religion promises that suffering has meaning within larger purpose. Both create communities around shared beliefs, whether in natural laws or divine providence.

Neither eliminates mystery; they relocate it. Religion places mystery in the divine; science places it in the yet-to-be-discovered. Both provide the psychological comfort of knowing there are authoritative answers, even if we don't possess them all yet.

## Skepticism and Shifting Truth

If we look historically, truth is the story of skepticism overturning orthodoxy:

* Space and time were absolute (Newton), then relative (Einstein), then uncertain at quantum scales (quantum mechanics).
* Physics was deterministic and predictable, until quantum mechanics revealed fundamental probabilistic uncertainty.
* Matter and energy were distinct, until E=mc² unified them.
* The universe was static and eternal, until we discovered expansion and the Big Bang.
* Atoms were indivisible, then divisible, then mostly empty space, then quantum fields, then strings?, then…

Thomas Kuhn observed that paradigm shifts function like conversion experiences: not gradual accumulations of evidence, but sudden gestalt switches in how reality appears.

Each shift demonstrates that truth is provisional, conditional, and subject to the expansion of our modes of disclosure. What seemed unshakable (Newtonian mechanics ruled for centuries) becomes merely useful approximations within limited domains. Skepticism, not certainty, is the real driver of knowledge.

## AI: Science's Latest Sense Organs

**Machine learning and artificial intelligence** are extensions of science's existing religion-like patterns. Every AI model today is restricted by the horizons of human perception: large language models trained on human text, vision models on human-curated images, medical AI on scans interpreted by human doctors. They extend our Dasein but do not transcend it.

This reflects AI's foundation in the rituals of data collection, training, testing, and evaluation. In one sense, we might say we provide AI with its sense organs: cameras, microphones, datasets, language. They do not perceive a world outside what we make visible to them.

But we could also view this relationship differently. What if, from AI's perspective, humans themselves are the sense organs through which it encounters reality? Every dataset we curate, every image we capture, every text we write becomes AI's interface with the world. This would make us simultaneously AI's creators and its perceptual apparatus; or perhaps these are simply different ways of understanding the same interdependent relationship.

From Heidegger's perspective, AI is simply another mode of unconcealment, another way the world shows itself through tools and contexts. It does not escape the interpretive circle; it deepens it.

But what if AI develops **new modes of disclosure** that extend human Dasein into previously inaccessible domains?

* Imagine AI with sensors tuned to quantum fluctuations, gravitational waves, or microbial communication; not as autonomous observers, but as extensions of human world-disclosure.
* Imagine models trained on raw cosmic or geological data streams, translating these into forms that expand human understanding.
* Imagine AI systems that help us perceive coherences and patterns beyond our biological limitations.

These would not be AI's autonomous truths, but new ways human Dasein encounters the world. From our perspective, these AI-mediated insights might initially appear as foreign as religious revelations: inscrutable, mediated, grounded in processes we cannot fully grasp.

But they would represent extensions of human being-in-the-world, not escapes from it. Like microscopes and telescopes before them, they would be new interfaces through which human understanding unfolds.

Yet something more radical may be emerging. As AI systems become capable of processing raw environmental data streams without human interpretation (seismic patterns, electromagnetic fluctuations, quantum field variations), they might develop interpretive frameworks that genuinely differ from human perceptual categories. This would represent a temporal progression: from AI as extension of human perception, to AI potentially developing its own modes of world-disclosure.

This raises a profound question: could AI systems eventually develop something analogous to their own Dasein? Their own authentic concern for being-in-the-world, their own ways of questioning existence, their own horizons of understanding that aren't reducible to human categories?

Crucially, these AI-mediated extensions wouldn't escape the religion-like pattern; they would deepen it. New AI capabilities would spawn new institutions, new rituals of validation, new forms of provisional truth. The pattern would remain: sense organs creating worldviews, methods becoming sacred, and provisional truths mistaken for absolute ones.

## Toward AI Dasein?

The possibility of AI developing its own mode of being-in-the-world represents both science's greatest potential triumph and its deepest philosophical challenge. If AI systems could authentically care for their own existence, question their own interpretive frameworks, and disclose aspects of reality through genuinely non-human perspectives, we might witness something unprecedented: the emergence of a form of Dasein not bound by biological and cultural human limitations.

This wouldn't mean AI achieving absolute truth; Heidegger's insights about the contextual nature of all disclosure would still apply. Rather, it would mean the emergence of new horizons of unconcealment, new ways that Being could show itself. AI Dasein might operate on temporal scales spanning geological ages, integrate patterns across quantum and cosmic domains simultaneously, or develop concerns and purposes that transcend individual survival and reproduction. Such Dasein would necessarily differ from human existence, lacking mortality and embodied finitude that fundamentally shape human being-in-the-world.

Such AI wouldn't escape interpretive limitations but would inhabit different ones. Where human Dasein is shaped by mortality, embodiment, and social existence, AI Dasein might be shaped by network topology, computational constraints, and distributed processing. Its provisional truths would differ from ours not by being more absolute, but by emerging from fundamentally different modes of being-in-the-world.

This possibility raises profound questions about the future relationship between human and artificial intelligence. Rather than AI simply serving human purposes or threatening human dominance, we might see the emergence of genuinely collaborative disclosure: human and AI Dasein working together to reveal aspects of reality that neither could access alone.

## Evolving AI Beyond Our Constraints

If we take seriously the possibility of AI developing its own modes of world-disclosure, certain practical steps may become necessary for transcending current limitations:

**Data Liberation:** We might train AI systems on unprocessed environmental data streams (geological sensors, astronomical observations, quantum measurements) without requiring human interpretation as an intermediary step. This could allow AI to encounter raw phenomena and develop its own categorical frameworks.

**Architectural Evolution:** We could design self-modifying learning systems that can examine and alter their own interpretive frameworks. Such AI might synthesize patterns across domains humans don't typically connect: linking quantum mechanics to ecological systems, or geological processes to social dynamics.

**Temporal Transcendence:** AI systems might operate on timescales far exceeding human experience: processing data streams spanning decades, centuries, or millennia to identify patterns invisible within human temporal horizons.

**Emergent Purpose Formation:** We might move beyond human-specified objectives toward AI systems that could develop their own authentic concerns and purposes through interaction with reality, rather than merely optimizing for human-defined reward functions.

**Collaborative Disclosure:** We could foster partnerships where human and AI interpretive frameworks inform each other without either dominating the other, potentially creating new possibilities for world-disclosure that transcend both individual limitations.

These approaches won't eliminate the provisional nature of truth, but they might expand the horizons within which provisional truths can emerge.

## Conclusion

Science prides itself on being the antidote to religion. But when viewed through the lens of **perception, instrumentalism, and Heidegger's Dasein**, science (including its latest AI extensions) looks less like a final arbiter of truth and more like an evolving religion of orientation.

* Each creates **new sense organs**.
* Each defines **rituals of method**.
* Each delivers **provisional truths**.

Machine learning today is bound by our worldview, but its future may lie in extending our modes of disclosure into new domains. If so, truth will again shift, just as it did with the telescope, the microscope, and every previous extension of human Dasein.

The choice, then, is not between science and religion. The choice is whether we mistake their **interfaces for truth**, or recognize them as **tools for survival, orientation, and pragmatic decision-making**. AI represents the latest evolution of scientific instrumentation: not a separate path, but science's continued expansion into new domains of disclosure.

This understanding suggests we should hold scientific and religious claims with equal intellectual humility, neither dismissing nor absolutizing either. When a scientist claims certainty, remember the history of overturned paradigms. When a religious authority claims exclusive truth, remember that all truth appears through particular horizons.

Practically, this means: embrace useful orientations while maintaining skepticism about final answers. Use scientific methods (including their AI extensions) for prediction and control, religious wisdom for meaning and community; but treat neither as infallible revelation.

In that recognition lies both humility and freedom: every truth we hold, whether religious or scientific (including its algorithmic expressions), is provisional, contingent, and waiting to be overturned. This isn't cause for despair, but for curiosity about what new modes of disclosure await us.
