A few years ago, I created a simple Vagrant setup to introduce beginners to the power and joy of the Linux command-line. If you're new to the command-line, this setup provides a structured way to explore and experiment with some useful tools.

You can find the setup here:

[GitHub Repository: Command-Line Tools Buzz Session](https://github.com/svo/command-line-tools-buzz-session)

This guide is intended for absolute beginners. If you're already a command-line wizard, feel free to move along-nothing new to see here. But if you're just getting started, these tools can help you build a solid foundation.

## Tools Introduced

Below is a list of essential command-line tools covered in this session, along with a brief explanation of their functionality.

- **locate** - Quickly find files on your system by name using a pre-built index.
- **ncdu** - A command-line tool for visualizing file system usage with navigable output.
- **tree** - Displays directory structures in a hierarchical format.
- **pstree** - Shows processes running on the system in a tree-like format.
- **nmap** - A powerful network scanner used to discover hosts and services on a network.
- **lsof** - Lists open files and the processes that are using them, including network ports.
- **mc** - Midnight Commander, a text-based file manager for the command-line.
- **who** - Shows who is currently logged into the system.
- **w** - Displays logged-in users along with their current activities.
- **write** - Sends messages to other users logged into the system.
- **watch** - Runs a command repeatedly at a set interval and displays the output.
- **find** - Searches for files and directories based on name, type, and other attributes.
- **cut** - Extracts specific columns or sections from each line of a file.
- **pushd** - Changes to a specified directory while saving the current one onto a stack.
- **popd** - Returns to the directory stored at the top of the stack.
- **xargs** - Passes output from one command as input to another, useful in command pipelines.
- **time** - Measures the execution time of a given command.
- **wondershaper** - A bandwidth-limiting tool that allows you to shape network traffic.
- **jq** - A lightweight and flexible command-line JSON processor.

These tools help users navigate, manage, and analyze systems efficiently. If youâ€™re looking to improve your Linux skills, experimenting with these commands is a great place to start.
